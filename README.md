##About
This is some old code from my undergraduate work about energy saving in server clusters from 2011.

I figured that someone may find it useful so I'm publishing it here.

##Documentation
There's some documentation in my monograph that may be helpful (if you can read portuguese): http://www.tempo.uff.br/arquivos/giulio_monografia.pdf

Other than that, feel free to ask me.
